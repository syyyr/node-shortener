# Node shortener

This is a small dumb url shortener, which I wrote, because I needed one and also want to get better at Typescript.

## Dependencies
- The ones in package.jsom
- MongoDB

## Usage
The path to Mongo is hardcoded and the database name is "shortener" (also hardcoded). I might get rid of hardcoded values, but this works for me now. The port is hardcoded. Everything is hardcoded, since I'm the only person using this.
```
git clone https://github.com/syyyr/node-shortener
cd node-shortener
npm install
npm start
```
